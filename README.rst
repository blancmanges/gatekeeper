Description
===========

This bot presents some efforts to make BitBucket usage arguably better.

Roadmap
=======

- initial set of features (#5);
- add default reviewers based on a file from repo (#9);
- automerge after enough votes and tests;
- interface for chat bots ([Gumby](https://github.com/blancmanges/gumby) is in line to get this);
- [technical] caching;
